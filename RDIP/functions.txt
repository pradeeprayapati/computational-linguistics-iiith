7.if we click on the "re-form the sentence" button all the selected words were diselected and were placed in their previous state.
8.if we click on the "check the correctness of this sentence" button we will get the result wheather the sentence we framed is correct or not.
9.if it is wrong we get another button named  "Get correct sentence" which on clicking shows all the correct answers and another button named "Hide the correct sentence" which on clicking hides the displayed correct sentences.
